						<p>I cried 2 days in a row.<br></p>
						<p>Was feeling weak & got to hate myself all over again. <br></p>
						<p>Now im dead sick, my body is sore, my head keeps spinning. I guess sometime being alone insuch days make me treasure what i had before. <br></p>

						<p><h3>IT'S SIMPLE</h3></p>
					
						<p>Since then, I hated & did’nt believe in what’s called “love”. <br>
						But I still got into dates because for me, there’s no reason fot the past to let you down. <br>
						I wasn’t sure, i didnt feel much when i got on the third, the forth... the tenth date with him? <br>
						I was afraid i forced myself too much to “feel” it again & if i was giving hope to someone who i am not interested in, i am scared of hurting people. Then I assumed he wasn’t my type because if he was, i would click after a few conversation like those i’d met before. I told him so. <br></p>
						<p>But in the face that he’s so genuine, kind & has high moral values kept me holding onto him, made me beleive that i would fall in love with him some day. <br></p>
						<p>And I did. <br></p>
